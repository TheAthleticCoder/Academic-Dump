## **AIM**

This project aims to serve its purpose of being an effective and easy introduction into the world of Algorithms. <br>
Very often we observe people getting scared at the sight of long lines of code and less logic or explanation. This repository is exactly the opposite of that. It has lesser lines of code and more emphasis into the different possible approaches to solve particular problems. The problems are relatable in real world scenario to help the beginners get comfortable with them.

## **FEATURES**
Some of the features of this project are-
1. It covers algorithms with vivid visualizations and explanations where ever possible. 
2. It has videos which can help in understanding difficult approaches and logic with ease (since some students love audio based learning.)
3. It covers mainly those algorithms which are classified based on their design methodology. 

The folder structure is-

1. Selection Algorithms
2. Greedy Algorithms
3. Divide And Conquer
4. Dynammic Programming
5. Report [PDF]
6. Extra Videos 

I hope that this piques your interest and makes you more confident when entering the world of Algorithm Analysis and Design.

I would like to thank my course professors and teacher assistants in giving me the chance and opportunity to do this project. With their valuable inputs and structured learning methods, it became relatively easy to understand and give direction and meaning to this project.
