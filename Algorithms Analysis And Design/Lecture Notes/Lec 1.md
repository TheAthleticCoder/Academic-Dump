Computer science is the study of computational processes and information processes. Information is the result of processing data by putting it in a particular context to reveal its meaning. Data are the raw facts or observations of nature and computation is the manipulation of data by some systematic procedure carried out by some computing agent.

Computational problems, in general, require a certain mode of approach or way of thinking. This approach is often called computational thinking and is similar, in many ways, to the scientific method where we’re concerned with making predictions.
Computational Thinking Steps: In order to make predictions using computational thinking, we need to define three steps related to the problem and its solution:

1. Problem Specification: We start by analyzing the problem, stating it precisely, and establishing the criteria for the solution. A computational thinking approach to a solution often starts by breaking complex problems down into more familiar or manageable sub-problems, sometimes called problem decomposition, frequently using deductive or probabilistic reasoning. This can also involve the ideas of abstraction and pattern recognition. More formally, we’d use these techniques in creating models and simulations.

2. Algorithmic Expression: We then need to find an algorithm, a precise sequence of steps, that solves the problem using appropriate data representations. This process uses inductive thinking and is needed for transferring a particular problem to a larger class of similar problems. This step is also sometimes called algorithmic thinking. We can further break it down into either imperative, like procedural or modular, and declarative, like functional, approaches to algorithmic solutions.

3. Solution Implementation & Evaluation: Finally, we create the actual solution and systematically evaluate it to determine its correctness and efficiency. This step also involves seeing if the solution can be generalized via automation or extension to other kinds of problems.

4. Decisional problem are the types of problem where each decision problem is characterized by a subset of the set of all possible inputs (that is, subset of, say, {0,1}*)​.He explained a few examples for the same.

Axioms of Computations are some basic facts that we need to keep in mind while solving a problem. Eg. Computer takes time to retrieve data from a far-off location , finite storage can store finite data and finite length code only exerts finite amount of control.

We compare solution and crown one better solution based on few criteria like case handling , error handling, space, time , graphical analysis etc.

## Computational problems Which arent answerable by computational technology

### **Countability and Computability**

*Theorem-1: The set of finite length bit strings {0,1}* is countable.

*Theorem-2: The power set of bit strings P({0,1}*) is uncountable​.

*Theorem 3: There are computational problems that computers can't solve*

## Church-Tuning Hypothesis
-----

The three axioms below represent the attributes of machines. 
They can be stated as:
1. **Machines are not omnipresent**: It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from far-off locations. Large memories are inherently sequential.
2. **Machines Are Not Omniscient​**: Only finite information can be stored in finite volume.
3. **Machines Are Not Omnipotent​**: A finite length code only exerts finite amount of control.

All these properties are followed by the the turing machine that has the simplest programming language.
